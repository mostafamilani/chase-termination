## Evaluation Scenarios

This repository contains data for two types of scenarios used in our experimental evaluation:

1. Synthetic scenarios: These scenarios comprise 45 sets of linear rules and 900 sets of simple linear rules, which can be accessed via the following link.
2. Existing sets of rules in the literature: These scenarios consist of the Deep rules family, the LUBM rules family with four databases of different sizes, and the iBench benchmarks, which include STB-128 and ONT-256.

The data and rules for all scenarios are available at https://bit.ly/41KCA5I.
