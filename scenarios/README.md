## Evaluation Scenarios

This repository contains data for two types of scenarios used in our experimental evaluation:

Synthetic scenarios: These scenarios comprise 45 sets of linear rules and 900 sets of simple linear rules, which can be accessed via the following link.

Existing sets of rules in the literature: These scenarios consist of the Deep rules family, the LUBM rules family with four databases of different sizes, and the iBench benchmarks, which include STB-128 and ONT-256.

The data and rules for all scenarios are available at this link.
