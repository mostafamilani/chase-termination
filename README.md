This repository provides a tool for checking chase termination for linear and simple linear existential rules, as well as a data generator and rule generator for testing the termination tool. The repository also includes scenarios of sample data and linear and simple linear rules that are generated using the data and rule generators.

The structure of the respository is as follows:
- scenarios: This folder includes links to the generated data and rules and their brief explanations.
- generators: This folder contains the code for the data generator and the rule generator and a brief description of how they can be used.
- chase-termination: This folder has the complete implementation of the termination algorithm.

To run the chase termination algorithm, use the following command:

check -options

where -options consists of
- ...
